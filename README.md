# Open Book Coding Exercise

## The Task A and B have been implemented separetely in the file taskA.js and taskB.js instead the taskC and taskD are implemented together in the angular app calculator in the folder calculator.

## taskA.js - Task A - Valid Expression

Write program that reads a mathematical expression and determines
whether such an expression is valid. For this exercise consider only
the following operators: +, −, ∗, /,sin, cos, tan. Do not use any external libraries for this part. 2

## taskB.js - Task B - Evaluate Expression

Given a valid expression evaluate. For example, sin(30) + cos(20) =
−0.5799495623.

## Task C - Calculator

Write a Single Page Application that allows the user to input an expression, validates the expression (on every keypress) and evaluates
the result. If the expression inputted by the user is invalid an error
message should be displayed. Do not use any external libraries for
this part. 3 3 Browser compatibility is not an issue
here, consider latest Chrome as your
test browser.

Add an area within the UI that will contain the last 5 expressions
and their computed results.

## Task D - Supr-Calculator

• Add a RAND operand that will generate a random number. The
RAND should get its input from endpoint https://www.random.org/
integers/?num=1&min=1&max=100&col=1&base=10&format=plain&
rnd=new
• Display a calculator UI with buttons for every digit and operator
allowing the user to input an expression without using the native
mobile keyboard. The layout should respond to device orientation.

# Instruction to run the task A and task B

type `node taskA.js`

type `node taskB.js`

# Instruction to run the app calculator (task C and task D)

## Install dependencies

Run `npm install`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
